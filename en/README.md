# Some Demos for Yandex Cloud and Yandex Datasphere

This repository contains the following samples:

* [ReviewAnalysis.ipynb](ReviewAnalysis.ipynb) - analyzing feedback for Moscow Railway Stations using Sentiment Analysis model from HuggingFace and YandexGPT

*More samples are available in [Russian version](../README.md)*

For the code to work correctly, you need to se the following Datasphere secrets: `folder_id` and `api_key`. Service account corresponding to those keys should have access rights to work with  YandexGPT, YandexART, Assistant API and Yandex Vision OCR. It would be more than enough to assign *editor* rights on the corresponding folder.
